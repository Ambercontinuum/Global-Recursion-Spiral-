Geographic Recursion Spiral (GRS) Analyzer

This Python project models the Geographic Recursion Spiral (GRS), a mathematical framework for understanding civilizational dynamics as recursive, waveform-like cycles originating from the Giza pyramid complex. Based on the research of Amber Anson (2025), this tool calculates spatial distances from Giza to historical nodes and computes each node's position within a 15,440-year civilizational cycle.

üìê Core Features

Haversine Distance Calculation: Measures great-circle distance between Giza and key historical nodes.

GRS Cycle Completion: Calculates the percentage completion of the civilizational cycle per historical year.

Embedded Node Dataset: Includes 11 historically significant locations and events.


üìÅ File Contents

geographic_recursion_spiral.py ‚Äî Main script to run the analysis.

README.md ‚Äî Project documentation (this file).


üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script.


2. Run the script using Python 3:

python geographic_recursion_spiral.py


3. View the printed output showing:

Distance from Giza in kilometers

Percentage of the GRS cycle completed for each historical node




üß† Example Output

Egyptian Origin: Distance 0.0 km, Cycle 0.00%
Sumerian Emergence: Distance 1438.0 km, Cycle 58.89%
Giza Peak: Distance 0.0 km, Cycle 70.20%
...
Gaza Crisis: Distance 361.2 km, Cycle 100.22%

üß™ Node Dataset

The historical nodes include:

Egyptian Origin (-13015 BCE)

Sumerian Emergence (-4000 BCE)

Giza Peak (-2500 BCE)

Exodus Transfer (-1300 BCE)

Harappa Emergence (-2600 BCE)

Rome Foundation (-753 BCE)

Rome Fall (476 CE)

Islamic Expansion (622 CE)

Crusades (1096 CE)

Ottoman Expansion (1450 CE)

Gaza Crisis (2025 CE)


üåå Theoretical Basis

Total civilizational cycle duration: 15,440 years

Origin year: -13,015 BCE

Overflow condition at: 100% cycle completion (approx. 1994 CE)

GRS defines history as a fractal waveform expanding and contracting from an informational origin

Gaza 2025 = 100.2% completion ‚Üí recursive overflow event
